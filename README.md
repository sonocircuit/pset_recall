# pset_recall

this is a example script/proof of concept of pset-recall integrated within a script. add this to your current script and adapt to taste.
the code is heavily commented for guidance.

- at script load a table is populated with the pset names.
- within params assign a pset to a slot.
- assign slots to grid keys/midi/etc. and load the corresponding pset with the push of a button.

**TODO:**

- optimize code
- make into a small lib
